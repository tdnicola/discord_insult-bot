<h1>Discord bot that insults your friends. </h1>

<h2>Throw a random insult/praise or just spice it up with a random/searched gif.</h2>

```
!insult @person
<br>
!praise @person
<br>
!gif
<br>
!gif searchterm
<br>
!moo sentence
<br>
!8ball question
<br>
!move to move a message (configure info below)
<br>
!help for info in chat on the commands
<br>

```

!move requires some configuring to work and most likely won't work on the live version because it is specific to each server.
<br>
Currently when called with !move it will search the last 20 messages in that channel for an emoji(that you specify) on the message you would like to move. 
<br>
If you wanted to clone and run yourself to work with it you would need to pull the emoji id you would like it to search for to move the message.
